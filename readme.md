# RabbitMQ Test Task

## Overview

The system is designed to get requests from side services to register users. The system consists of two modules: 
Request Handler and DB Manager. Message processing between these modules is done using RabbitMQ. 

## Request Handler

Request Handler handles requests from Tomcat server it is running on, and creates messages to DB Manager to create 
a new User, or get the existing one.

### REST API:

`/get?id={user id}` returns JSON representation of the User object if there is one with id provided. If no User object 
with this id found in DB, "user not found" message will be shown.

`/create?login={login}&password={password}&name={name}&surname={surname}&email={email}` creates User with given 
credentials in DB and returns it's JSON representation.

`/create0` creates User object with default credentials.

## DB Manager

DB Manager receives messages from RabbitMQ containing requests to create a new user record or search for an existing 
one with given id in the DB.

### User Entity

`id` - autogenerated index of the user

`login, password, name, surname, email` - plain strings

`datetime` - user creation datetime
